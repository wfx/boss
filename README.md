# BOSS
BOSS is a installer for the "Best Operating System System".
Arch linux, what else.

I wrote my repeating reinstalling steps into a simple script.
So it fits only my needs.

Howto to try it:
- Dont use it in real!
- Startup a virtual machine with 2 virtual devices and boot the archiso.
- curl -o boss.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wfx/boss/main/boss.sh
- get on of the prepared configs
  curl -o boss.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wfx/boss/main/kvm_one_drive.json
- Run boss.sh
- Dont forget step 1!
