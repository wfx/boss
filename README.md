# BOSS
BOSS is a installer for the "Best Operating System System".
Arch linux, what else.

I wrote my repeating reinstalling steps into a simple script.
So it fits only my needs.

Howto to try it:
- 1 Dont use it in real!
- 2 Stratup a virtual machine and boot the archiso.
- 3 Install wget and get the script.
- 4 Make it executable and run it.
- 5 Dont forget step 1!

have a lot of fun
